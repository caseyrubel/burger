## Description
***
Burger is an application that:
* Add a burger to the burger menu
* Press the eat-da-burger button to send it to the devoured list
* Delete the burger from the devoured section 

Although this app is simple, it is a great demonstration of how to use MySQL and keep data persitant. The app also shows a use for the Handlebars templating engine.
